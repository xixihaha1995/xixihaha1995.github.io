# Conventions

scalar $s \in \mathcal{R}^1$, vector $v\in \mathcal{R}^m$,

what is the size of $\frac{\partial v}{\partial s}$?  Column vector $\mathcal{R}^{m\times 1}$

what is the size of $\frac{\partial s}{\partial v}$?  Row vector $\mathcal{R}^{1\times m}$

what is the size of $\frac{\partial vectorone}{\partial vectortwo}$? Matrix $\mathcal{R}^{vectoroneDimen \times vectortwoDimen}$; A matrix of partial derivatives is called a **Jacobian**
